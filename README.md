# daily-planner

Daily planner for managing time effectively

# Description

For this project, the goal was to create a daily planner for users to add their daily tasks or events. The time blocks display in different colors depending on how each time block compares to the current hour. The past hour(s) will display as grey. The present hour will display as red. The future hour(s) will display as green. The user can input any notes/tasks/events/etc. into any time block and after clicking the save button for each time block with input text, the planner will still display all user inputs even after refreshing the page.
